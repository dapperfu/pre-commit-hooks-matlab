function closeSubSystems(system)
% closeSubSystems(model)
%   Close all open subsystems. Sometimes when opening a model from someone
%   else (or yourself) Simulink will re-open all of the previously opened
%   subsystems. closeSubSystems will close all open subsystems leaving only
%   the model open.
